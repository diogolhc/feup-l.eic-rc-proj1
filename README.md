# Computer Networks - Data Link Protocol


## Description  

The goal of this project was to implement a data link protocol according to the given
[specification](Data_Link_Protocol_EN_FBT.pdf) and to test it in the
[lab](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/instal_geral.espaco_view?pv_id=74614) with a simple
data transfer application also specified in the [same document](Data_Link_Protocol_EN_FBT.pdf).

The implemented protocol allows the error-free transmission of files via serial port
connecting 2 computers. It is resistant to both interference and disconnection.

This project was developed by Diogo Luís Henriques Costa 
(up201906731@edu.fe.up.pt) and Francisco José Barbosa Marques 
Colino (up201905405@edu.fe.up.pt) for
[RCOM 2021-22](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=484435).
